 1. parallellAlgebraicAttacks.sage which is a file that contains the complete algebraic attack on SIMON32.
 2. branchAndBound.c contains two parts; part one creates a DDT and the second part is a branch and bound search that uses the DDT to find a differential.
 3. keyRecoveryAttack.c contains the differential attack that uses a differential that was found with the branchAndBound file.
